{"id":"emacs-gravity-2nh","title":"Async Cockpit / Inbox UX","description":"Unified inbox for managing multiple Claude sessions asynchronously. Adds 'Attention Required' and 'Waiting for Input' sections to overview buffer. Bidirectional items (permissions, questions, plan reviews) open in ephemeral action buffers with single-key bindings. Idle sessions show stop_text snippet. Mode-line badge with counts, pulse, and minibuffer flash for new critical items. Full design at .claude/plans/resilient-sniffing-quilt.md","design":"# Async Cockpit / Inbox — Design\n\n## The Problem\n\nUser runs 3-5 Claude sessions across different projects simultaneously. Today they must:\n1. Open overview → find the right session → open it → scroll to the pending item\n2. Permission requests / questions interrupt via minibuffer — easy to miss if you're in another buffer\n3. No unified view of \"what needs my attention right now\"\n4. Sessions waiting for input (idle after Stop) are invisible unless you poll the overview\n\n## Design Principles\n\n- **Async-first**: The user is NOT watching Claude. They're coding. Inbox items accumulate silently.\n- **Glanceable**: One section in the overview tells you everything waiting.\n- **Act-in-place**: React to items via ephemeral action buffers without losing your place.\n- **Emacs-idiomatic**: Leverage magit-section, ephemeral action buffers (like `with-editor`), mode-line, pulse.\n\n---\n\n## What Goes in the Inbox\n\nItems are created when a session **needs user attention**:\n\n| Priority | Event | Trigger | Action Required |\n|----------|-------|---------|-----------------|\n| Critical | PermissionRequest | `needs_response=true` | Approve/Deny/Allow-always |\n| Critical | AskUserQuestion | `needs_response=true` | Select option or free text |\n| High | ExitPlanMode | `needs_response=true` | Review plan, approve/deny |\n| Medium | Stop (idle) | Session becomes idle after Stop | Read result, send next prompt |\n\n**Not inbox items**: SessionStart/End (overview handles these), Notifications (mode-line), tools in progress (session buffer).\n\nThe \"Stop → idle\" item means: \"this session finished and is waiting for you.\" One item per session, replaced on each new Stop. No delta tracking.\n\n---\n\n## Decisions Made\n\n1. **Inbox lives in the overview buffer** — as a top section \"Attention Required\" above the project list. One buffer to manage everything.\n\n2. **Action UX: Ephemeral action buffers** — RET on an inbox item opens a lightweight buffer in a side window with:\n   - Full context (question text, permission details, plan content)\n   - Single-key bindings for actions\n   - Auto-closes when action is taken\n   - This generalizes the existing plan-review-buffer pattern\n\n   Transients don't handle paragraph text well. Ephemeral action buffers are more Emacs-idiomatic (cf. `with-editor`, `org-capture`, plan review mode). Short items (permissions) get a compact buffer; long items (questions, plans) get full rendering.\n\n3. **Notification: Mode-line badge + pulse + minibuffer** — upgrade existing `claude-gravity--notification-indicator` to show counts. Brief minibuffer message on new critical items. Pulse the overview buffer's inbox section when new items arrive.\n\n---\n\n## Overview Buffer Layout (with Inbox)\n\n```\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nStructured Claude Sessions  ◆ 5 sessions\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n▼ Attention Required (3)\n    ▸ ⚡ [myproject] Permission: Bash(rm -rf build/)           2m\n    ▸ ❓ [api-work] Question: Which database adapter?          5m\n    ▸ 📋 [myproject] Plan ready for review                     1m\n\n▼ Waiting for Input (2)\n    ● [api-work] Turn 4 complete — idle                       30s\n    ● [frontend] Turn 2 complete — idle                        2m\n\n▼ myproject (2)\n    ● myproject responding  [12 tools]\n    ● myproject idle 5m  [8 tools]\n\n▼ api-work (1)\n    ● api-work idle 30s  [6 tools]\n...\n```\n\n**Two new sections at top:**\n- **Attention Required**: Bidirectional items needing response (permission, question, plan review). Sorted by timestamp, newest first. Items disappear when acted upon.\n- **Waiting for Input**: Sessions that are idle after a Stop. One entry per session. Disappears when session starts responding again (UserPromptSubmit or new tool).\n\n---\n\n## Action Buffer Pattern\n\nWhen user presses RET on an inbox item, an **action buffer** opens in a bottom side window:\n\n### Permission Action Buffer\n```\n*Claude Action: Permission*\n───────────────────────────\nSession: myproject (turn 3)\nTool: Bash\n\n  rm -rf build/ \u0026\u0026 npm run build\n\n───────────────────────────\n[a] Allow  [A] Allow always  [d] Deny  [q] Cancel\n```\n\n### Question Action Buffer\n```\n*Claude Action: Question*\n───────────────────────────\nSession: api-work (turn 2)\n\nWhich database adapter should I use for the migration?\nThe current setup uses PostgreSQL with Knex, but I noticed\nthere are also references to Prisma in the package.json.\nShould I standardize on one?\n\nOptions:\n  [1] Keep Knex (Recommended)\n  [2] Migrate to Prisma\n  [3] Use both\n\n───────────────────────────\n[1-3] Select option  [o] Other (free text)  [q] Cancel\n```\n\n### Plan Review\nExisting plan-review-mode buffer flow (already works well). Just triggered from inbox item instead of minibuffer interrupt.\n\n### \"Waiting for Input\" Action\nRET on a waiting session → just opens the session buffer (existing `claude-gravity-open-session`). If it's a tmux session, could also offer a transient to send next prompt.\n\n**Key properties of action buffers:**\n- Displayed via `display-buffer-in-side-window` (bottom, 30-40% height)\n- Own minor mode with single-key bindings\n- `q` always cancels/closes without action\n- On action: sends response to socket, kills buffer, removes inbox item, refreshes overview\n- Buffer-local variables hold socket proc + item data (same pattern as plan review)\n\n---\n\n## Data Model\n\n### Inbox Entry (alist)\n\n```elisp\n`((id . \"inbox-001\")               ; unique id (uuid or counter)\n  (type . permission)               ; permission | question | plan-review | idle\n  (session-id . \"abc-123\")\n  (project . \"myproject\")           ; for display\n  (label . \"myproject\")             ; session label\n  (timestamp . ,(current-time))     ; when created\n  (priority . 0)                    ; 0=critical 1=high 2=medium\n  (summary . \"Bash(rm -rf build/)\") ; one-line display text\n  (data . ,payload)                 ; original event payload\n  (socket-proc . ,proc))            ; for bidirectional; nil for idle items\n```\n\n### Storage\n\n```elisp\n(defvar claude-gravity--inbox nil\n  \"List of inbox items, newest first. Each item is an alist.\")\n```\n\nSimple list. Small cardinality (rarely more than 10 items). No need for hash table.\n\n### Lifecycle\n\n1. **Created**: In `claude-gravity--server-filter` (bidirectional) or `handle-event` for Stop→idle\n2. **Acted**: User takes action in action buffer → item removed from inbox, response sent\n3. **Superseded**: For idle items, new Stop for same session replaces previous idle item\n4. **Expired**: On SessionEnd, remove all inbox items for that session\n\n---\n\n## Mode-line Badge\n\nUpgrade `claude-gravity--notification-indicator` to show inbox counts:\n\n```\n [Claude: 2⚡ 1📋]     ← 2 critical (permission/question), 1 plan review\n [Claude: ✓]           ← nothing pending, all good\n [Claude]              ← no sessions active\n```\n\nUpdate logic: recompute on every inbox mutation. Use faces for color coding.\n\nPulse: on new critical item, briefly flash the mode-line segment using `pulse-momentary-highlight-region` on the mode-line string (or use `face-remap-add-relative` with a timer).\n\nMinibuffer: `(message \"Claude: Permission request from %s\" project)` — brief, non-blocking.\n\n---\n\n## Integration Points\n\n### Server Filter Changes\n\nCurrent flow (bidirectional):\n```\nserver-filter → needs_response=true → run-at-time 0 → completing-read in minibuffer\n```\n\nNew flow:\n```\nserver-filter → needs_response=true → create inbox item (with socket-proc) → refresh overview → mode-line update + minibuffer flash\n                                                          ↓ (later, when user acts)\n                                                   action buffer → send response → remove item\n```\n\nThe `run-at-time 0` trick is still needed but now it defers to **inbox insertion** rather than `completing-read`. The socket proc is stored in the inbox item and stays alive until the user acts.\n\n### Stop Event Changes\n\nIn `claude-gravity-handle-event` for \"Stop\":\n```\nAfter setting claude-status to idle →\n  Create/replace idle inbox item for this session\n  Refresh overview\n```\n\n### Overview Render Changes\n\n`claude-gravity--render-overview` gains two new sections at the top:\n1. `claude-gravity-insert-inbox-attention` — critical/high items\n2. `claude-gravity-insert-inbox-waiting` — idle session items\n\nBoth render before the project-grouped session list.\n\n---\n\n## Keybindings\n\n### Overview buffer (new/modified)\n| Key | Action |\n|-----|--------|\n| `RET` | On inbox item → open action buffer. On session → open session (existing) |\n| `k` | Dismiss inbox item (for idle items; bidirectional items can't be dismissed) |\n\n### Action buffer minor mode\n| Key | Action |\n|-----|--------|\n| `a` | Allow (permission) |\n| `A` | Allow always (permission) |\n| `d` | Deny (permission/plan) |\n| `1-9` | Select option (question) |\n| `o` | Other / free text (question) |\n| `C-c C-c` | Approve (plan review) |\n| `q` | Cancel / close without action |\n\n---\n\n## Design Decisions\n\n- **Idle items show snippet**: Extract `stop_text` (or last tool summary if no stop_text) for idle inbox items. E.g., \"Turn 4: Created 3 files, ran tests — all passing\". Truncated to ~80 chars.\n- **Permissions one at a time**: Each permission is its own inbox item. Sequential, simple, matches current mental model.\n- **Ordering**: Within each section (Attention / Waiting), chronological newest-first.\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Phases\n\n### Phase 1: Data model + inbox section in overview\n- Inbox entry alist structure\n- `claude-gravity--inbox` list with add/remove/query helpers\n- Render \"Attention Required\" and \"Waiting for Input\" sections in overview\n- Wire Stop→idle to create inbox items\n- Wire SessionEnd to clean up items\n\n### Phase 2: Action buffers for bidirectional items\n- Generalized action buffer pattern (minor mode, side window, auto-close)\n- Permission action buffer\n- Question action buffer\n- Plan review triggered from inbox (reuse existing plan-review-mode)\n- Rewire server-filter to create inbox items instead of immediate minibuffer prompts\n\n### Phase 3: Mode-line badge + notifications\n- Upgrade notification indicator to show inbox counts with faces\n- Minibuffer flash on new critical items\n- Pulse inbox section in overview buffer\n\n### Phase 4: Polish\n- Idle item shows assistant response snippet\n- `k` to dismiss idle items\n- Auto-expire very old idle items\n- Ensure plan review action buffer inherits existing comment/diff features","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","owner":"georgi.danov@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-07T14:41:23.390786+01:00","created_by":"gdanov","updated_at":"2026-02-07T14:41:23.390786+01:00"}

Should: toggle on/off with a keybinding, show indicator in header/mode-line when active, automatically call tail logic after each buffer refresh, and disable when user manually navigates (scroll/movement) to avoid fighting user intent.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"georgi.danov@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-06T00:05:24.112896+01:00","created_by":"gdanov","updated_at":"2026-02-07T22:25:39.00174+01:00","closed_at":"2026-02-07T22:25:39.00174+01:00","close_reason":"Implemented follow mode with f toggle, auto-tail on refresh, auto-disable on manual scroll, mode-line indicator [F]"}
